## Duplicate Crossword Game

### Object

Unscramble the letters on the rack to create the **highest scoring word** you
can find (normally the longest word) to outscore your opponents over **7
rounds** of play.

---

### Setup

- **Clear a space** on the table.
- **Load all letter tiles** into the bag.
- **Provide equipment:** Each player needs an answer board and a dry erase
  marker.
- **Draw 8 tiles** and display them for everyone to see.

---

### Game Play

1. **Secret Submission:** Each player secretly writes down the highest scoring
   words they can find. You may write multiple words, but focus on your best
   attempt.
2. **Timing (Optional):** \* Set a **3-minute timer** for all players.

- _OR_ use a **1-minute timer** to nudge the final player if everyone else is
  finished.

3. **The Reveal:** Once all players are ready, reveal the answer boards. Each
   player declares their highest scoring word.
4. **Recording & Placing:** \* Record the scores for every player based on their
   individual submission.

- **Only the highest scoring word** among all players is placed onto the main
  board.
- _Tie-breaker:_ If scores are tied, use the word played by the player with the
  **lowest overall score**.

5. **Next Round:**

- **Rounds 1–6:** Draw new letters from the bag to bring the rack back up to 8
  tiles.
- **Round 7:** After the final scores are recorded, the player with the highest
  cumulative score wins.

### Scoring

A play scores all words created by laying out new tiles horizontally or
vertically to overlap or extend existing plays.

- **Calculation:** Add the values of all letters involved in each new word
  created (letters participating in two words are double-counted).
- **The Multiplier:** Multiply that total by the **length of the longest word**
  played.
- **Strategy Tip:** Because of the length multiplier, it is usually better to
  play the longest word possible, even if it uses low-value letters.

> **Note:** Although everyone earns points for their own best word, only the
> single highest-scoring word is added to the board. Always record your best
> find, even if it uses letters you were hoping to save!
