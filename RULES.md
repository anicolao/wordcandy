### Game Play

1. **Find Your Word:** You have a rack of 8 letters. Find the best word you can that connects to the existing words on the global board (or starts the game if it's the first move).
2. **Scoring:** The game will automatically calculate the score of your word as you place tiles.
3. **Submit:** When you are satisfied with your word, submit it.
4. **The Global Board:** The highest-scoring word submitted by *any* player globally becomes the "official" move for the board, but you get points for *your* submission.

### Scoring

A play scores all words created by laying out new tiles horizontally or vertically to overlap or extend existing plays.

- **Step 1: Letter Sum:** Add the values of all letters involved in each new word created.
    - **Crosswords Count:** If a placed tile is part of two newly formed words (e.g., horizontal and vertical), its value is counted **twice**.
- **Step 2: The Multiplier:** Multiply that total sum by the **length of the longest word** created by your play.
    - *Example:* If you play "ZOO" and it forms "ZOO" (3 letters) and "NO" (2 letters), the multiplier is **3** (from "ZOO").
- **Strategy Tip:** Because of the length multiplier, it is usually better to play the longest word possible, even if it uses low-value letters.

> **Note:** Although everyone earns points for their own best word, only the single highest-scoring word from the community is added to the global board for the next day's challenge.
